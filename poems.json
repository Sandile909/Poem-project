    "poem": "You are strong, you are brave, Your spirit unbroken, your heart unafraid. You've faced challenges, you've overcome fears, And through it all, you've grown stronger through the years. \n Your dreams are valid, your goals are real, Don't let anyone dull your sparkle, don't let anyone steal. Your passion, your fire, your drive, Keep pushing forward, you'll reach the other side. \n Remember why you started, remember what you sought, Don't give up now, you're closer than you thought. Keep moving forward, one step at a time, You got this, you're capable, you're one of a kind. \n Believe in yourself, trust in your might, You are capable of achieving greatness, shining bright. So don't give up, don't lose your way, Keep pushing forward, a brighter day. \n You are a warrior, a fighter, a star, Shining bright in the darkness, near and far. Your voice matters, your story counts, Keep sharing, keep shining, don't back down. \n You are enough, you are worthy, you are strong, Keep moving forward, all day long. Remember to breathe, remember to rest, You got this, you're doing your best.",
